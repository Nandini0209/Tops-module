# What is the purpose continue statement in python?

'''The purpose of the continue statement is to selectively skip certain parts of the loop's body based on certain conditions,
without terminating the entire loop. When Python encounters a continue statement within a loop, it immediately stops executing
the remaining code inside the loop for the current iteration and jumps to the next iteration.'''
